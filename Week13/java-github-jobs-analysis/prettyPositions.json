    "title": "Engineering Manager",
    "description": "<p>Paxos was founded in 2012 as the first institutional and regulated crypto-exchange, our founding team quickly realized there was an opportunity to establish ourselves as the trusted leader in digital assets. By creating regulated digital assets like our USD-backed stablecoin PAX, we’re giving customers the chance to process their financial transactions in safer, faster and more cost-effective ways. We’re also building solutions for some of the world’s best-known financial institutions to settle day-to-day transactions faster, cheaper and with the most modern technology. We believe the global financial system has relied too long on closed infrastructure and outdated technologies - it's time for a change.</p>\n<p>We are looking for an Engineering Manager to join our rapidly growing FinTech company. This role will be reporting directly to the SVP of Engineering and will have a huge impact on the technical direction of the entire company. This includes providing architectural guidance, mentoring other engineers, evaluating new technologies and industry changes, and defining and leading company best practices. This will also include interfacing with other leading technology companies and universities in the future of the blockchain industry.</p>\n<p>What you will do:\nYou will produce a work output by taking a complex user story, breaking it down into sub-tasks, and delegating and completing the sub-tasks with relative ease – own design, coding, testing all the way through deployment of each of those sub-tasks.\nYou will build and lead a strong team of junior and senior software engineers and participate in code reviews resulting in up leveling the skill sets for the team as a whole.\nYou will identify and proactively tackle technical debt before it grows into something that requires significant up-front work to resolve. A rule of thumb is to start looking into root cause of issues whenever there is noise. There is no smoke without fire.\nYou will strike the right balance between fixing the problem at hand and focusing on finding the root cause of the problem. For example, if it’s a production issue the priority is to fix the immediate problem and collect all the data necessary for root cause analysis. In a non-production environment, the focus should be on finding the root cause and fixing it the right way to make sure the problem doesn’t occur again.\nYou'll work cross-functionally across Product, Engineering and Operations business units\nWhat you need to have:\nSignificant technical experience building business-critical software applications\nYears of people management experience, including hiring and developing engineering talent\nThe ability to work in a fast-paced, agile, and (sometimes) ambiguous environment with multiple priorities and stakeholders\nHands on software development experience (“player coach”) and are comfortable writing code\nHave worked in different technical stacks in the past with full-stack exposure (front end, back end, database), with a continuous development/continuous deployment pipeline, possibly in a 24/7 support environment\nOther than these qualifications, we're hoping to bring someone on board who loves what they do and can't wait to join an amazing team!</p>\n<p>Who we are: We are a diverse group of individuals with backgrounds and experience in banking, startups, tech giants, and big-five consulting firms. We currently have about 110 employees across offices in New York, London and Singapore and have big plans for our growth. We’re looking for collaborative, creative, hard-working and intellectually curious people to help us make our vision a reality.</p>\n<p>Why we matter: Paxos is the only technology company building financial services solutions that both customers and regulators can trust. We’re committed to pushing the boundaries of technology while also working with important stakeholder groups so we can build a financial system that is open and accessible to anyone around the world.</p>\n<p>Who are our customers: Our customers run the gamut from individuals seeking access to digital assets and those who don’t want to be tied to a physical banking system, to large institutions seeking to improve their settlement infrastructure. Some of our clients today include big names like Credit Suisse, Societe Generale, Macquarie, INTL FCStone and Virtu.</p>\n<p>How we work: Paxos is driven by our four values. We believe that every Paxos employee is an owner, and employees consistently search for the truth in their work. We also believe in real-time candor and a shared commitment to excellence. These values are ingrained in everything we do and influence how we communicate and collaborate as an organization.</p>\n<p>Why we are a great place to work:  Paxos has been consistently named a Best Place to Work by BuiltIn. We offer all of the usual startup stuff like healthy snacks, coffee, and ping pong but we also offer generous healthcare coverage, PTO, and family leave. (We want employees to care for themselves both in and out of office.) In addition to the benefits and perks, Paxos offers employees the chance to have a real and measurable impact on a growing business: what you do today directly influences the Company goals. As a result, we enable every employee to substantially grow their careers.</p>\n<p>Paxos is an equal opportunity employer. It does not discriminate on the basis of sex, age, color, race, religion, marital status, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, physical and mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, veteran status or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer - Node.js (UK Based)</strong></p>\n<p><em><em>Please note that this role is UK-based. You must be based within the UK and have a valid right to work. We are unable to offer sponsorship at the time</em>\n<strong>Agencies: please kindly note that we have a select list of partners with whom we already work</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>This isn’t just another tech start-up looking for another software engineer…</strong>\nFirstly, we’re not just any tech start-up (actually, 8 years down the line, we’re more of a scale-up now). At Gecko, we’re the proud creators of a meaningful SaaS solution that has allowed today's Higher Ed institutions to connect with over 6 million students worldwide.</p>\n<p>And we’re not looking for ‘just’ another software engineer; we don’t just employ skills or qualifications - although, often they are handy, albeit even necessary. Instead, our hiring approach is always centred around finding our next ‘Gecko’.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a ‘Gecko’?</strong>\nAlthough we’re massively into automation, we are humans - not Bots! Each Gecko brings a different perspective, a solution-orientated mindset and not to mention their own “je ne sais quoi”. It's ambition, drive and curiosity all rolled into an individual who doesn’t just have the ability, but also the personality and the potential (but no egos allowed).</p>\n<p>You won't only be part of the Engineering team but the whole Gecko team; Product Managers, Designers, Customer Success people... Working with the whole Gecko team across a pretty flat hierarchy means that every Gecko is empowered to input ideas on how we can improve anything and everything – from our products, systems and processes to large-scale company-wide decisions (including the important ones like where we used to order lunch).</p>\n<p>In our Engineering team, we’re on that path of constantly trying to get better at what we do and love to share whatever we learn along the way; whether it's quirky resources, the latest tools, new languages (or even a new cooking recipe). We love to get excited about great code and can appreciate awesome craftmanship. Our projects also include a bit of something for everyone; from legacy code to greenfield, spread across two main product suites incorporating a diverse tech stack. We like to experiment; failing fast and learning faster mean that, in our Agile world, making mistakes isn’t a bad thing. We are also big advocates of paired programming and nothing is released until we have a code review and it is properly tested (we value working software over comprehensive documentation).</p>\n<p><strong>We’re looking for that true Node.js expert…</strong>\nThat’s someone who exemplifies the highest standard in software engineering and the potential to do great things with this. Someone who ensures that the team’s decisions and output consistently help empower our customers and strengthen our engineering capability.</p>\n<p>Some of the other things you’ll be doing include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborating when designing and implementing low-latency, high availability and performant software across two-week sprint cycles.</li>\n<li>Being a true codebase whizz, providing technical direction and sharing knowledge of how to design features around our codebase across the team.</li>\n<li>Consistently delivering high-quality code; maintaining code quality across the team by regularly conducting code reviews.</li>\n<li>Being a highly experienced, senior engineer, you will naturally step up when needed; mentoring junior team members, confidently stepping in and assisting the Lead and VP in facilitating our Agile ceremonies and helping to build on an amazing engineering culture.</li>\n<li>Implementing and maintaining our critical security and data protection protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we’re looking for someone who truly is excited by all of this and feels passionate about the thought of building the best student engagement platform using the best technologies.</p>\n<p>Success in this role will lead to potential opportunities for growth across the entire engineering team with significant scope for future development.</p>\n<p>But enough about us, more about you...\nRequirements</p>\n<p><strong>This job might be for you if:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have super-strong expertise in Node.js, its ecosystem and ES6 – it’s your bread and butter.</li>\n<li>You understand and can demonstrate the nature of functional and asynchronous programming.</li>\n<li>You’re all over fundamental design principles behind scalable applications.</li>\n<li>You get excited about creating database schemas that represent and support business processes.</li>\n<li>You work with code versioning tools such as Git.</li>\n<li>Facilitating key team activities and supporting Leads and your team has your name written all over it!</li>\n<li>With a real passion for problem-solving, your solution-centric mindset allows you to think creatively which means you are able to come up with solid technical solutions to novel ideas &amp; challenges which arise from business as it scales</li>\n<li>Being naturally curious and an active learner, you are always learning and get excited by working collaboratively with those around you. You also like to share this knowledge and help others grow as much as you can (there’s no “I” in team, as they say)</li>\n<li>You’re ambitious and driven – you want to grow personally and professionally.</li>\n<li>You are a true Gecko at heart; you just didn’t know it yet! You want to make that move to become part of something which matters to you and where you’re valued in return.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We’d be over the moon if you also had:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expertise in working with Agile Development Methodologies.</li>\n<li>Already worked with and developed Microservices and Message-Orientated Service-Orientated Architectures.</li>\n<li>Involvement with Docker or container orchestration tools.</li>\n<li>Encountered continuous integration and continuous delivery.</li>\n<li>Familiarity with AWS, React, React Native, PHP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Join Gecko?</strong>\nWhy not? Joining Gecko, you will have the opportunity to learn from and work alongside some of the most passionate and driven people in the industry. Equally, this exciting time for Gecko presents a unique opportunity to embed yourself into the business at this early stage and to grow and develop as the Company grows.</p>\n<p>Our platform of market-leading EdTech products are used by Higher Ed institutions across the world to improve the way they recruit students, drive efficiencies in inquiry acquisition and increase conversion rates. Our software has helped universities connect with over 6 million students worldwide, whether they’re capturing inquiries at recruitment fairs in far-flung corners of the globe, registering attendees on to campus tours, or helping freshmen navigate the new world of higher education, our customers trust us to help deliver a great experience for their students. Oh, and we built our very own (and very clever) ChatBot too - did we mention that?</p>\n<p>We're growing fast; in fact, in the last 12 months alone we doubled our headcount, managing 100+ clients across the globe. We’ve got big plans for our leading EdTech products, but we also like to have fun; and lots of it. But like many other businesses across the globe this year, we've had to adapt from life in our colourful modern Edinburgh New Town office to a remote, home-working setup. So, we've purposely tried to continue the traditions or rituals in a virtual setting, such as 'Friday pub', 'coffees' or 'meditation sessions', as well as creating whole new ones like our new fitness channel or games nights.</p>\n<p>Some other nice things about working for Gecko (apart from the fact we're all just really nice people) include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive Salary + Commission</li>\n<li>MacBook Pro</li>\n<li>Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones</li>\n<li>Flexible working week</li>\n<li>Work from anywhere / work from home</li>\n<li>Pension Scheme</li>\n<li>Employee perks with 'Perkbox'</li>\n<li>28 days Holiday (plus 4 days at Christmas and New Year, AND your Birthday off - so 33 really)</li>\n<li>EMI Share Option Scheme (after qualifying length of service)</li>\n<li>Access to Mental Health Coach (who is just awesome)</li>\n<li>Lots of other benefits in the office (such as free breakfast, soda fridge, coffee machine, fortnightly lunches, ping pong to name but a few)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, if all of this sounds like your cup of tea then just hit ‘Apply’ and get started… see you there!</p>\n<p>*Please note that the interview process for successful applicants will include a video-questionnaire and a technical test as well as video interview(s)</p>\n<p>Apply here via the <a href=\"https://ltpx.nl/EMV779L\"><strong>application form</strong></a>!</p>\n<p><em>Agency calls are not appreciated.</em><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a6992f43c820fe84f7b2c675e5514cfe2345960a/68747470733a2f2f62636f6e74726f6c2e62726f636b6d657965722e6e6c2f747261636b2e7068703f6f7264657269643d313831363933\"></p>\n",

A little about us, a little about what we believe and what we are looking for.</p>\n<p>Podsights is an attribution platform for podcast advertising. We likely work with your favorite publisher and handle over 3 billion events with 500M impressions a month.</p>\n<p>Our mission is to grow the podcast industry. Far too many brands try a podcast advertising campaign and churn. Or worse: they don't enter the market at all. By providing a platform for brands to optimize results, we encourage investment in podcast advertising, and by proxy to publishers.</p>\n<p>Your role will be a generalist, but with a specific focus on the software stack's middle layer. On a given day, you would be handling our feed ingestion pipeline, speech-to-text on audio content, or building our API. The benefit of joining a small team is you will have a tremendous impact on the company's direction and, to some extent, the industry.</p>\n<p>The podcasting industry has seen a lot of growth in the past few years, and we believe it has more room to grow. Beyond growth, podcasting presents some interesting problems: its decentralized, RSS-based nature, and the various ways people can listen. Joining Podsights is an excellent opportunity to be hands-on with an evolving medium.</p>\n<p>We believe that where you went to school has little bearing on your performance as a software engineer. Where you live isn't a proxy for talent. Your current employer provides low signal about your future potential.</p>\n<p>At Podsights, we look for ambition and curiosity. We love engineers that aren't solely interested in the craft of developing software. Want to start a company of your own one day? Yes, we want to talk. Are you interested in the business side of software? Tell us more.</p>\n<p>We want curious engineers. You take things apart and see how they work.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you will have 2+ years of experience as a software or data engineer. Our current stack includes Python, Google Cloud (Dataflow, Cloud Functions, Spanner, etc.), React, Apollo, Go, Node, and potentially whatever you bring to the table.</p>\n<p>Our team consists of members of Embedly (acquired by Medium), Horizon Media, Claritas, NPM, and How Stuff Works. You can learn more about us here: podsights.com/team</p>\n<p>If the above interests you, drop us a <a href=\"https://podsights.breezy.hr/p/90b411af5bfe-software-engineer\">note</a>. We're less worried about a resume (LinkedIn is fine), but more importantly, tell us about your ideal next role.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This job post is for individuals. No agencies please.</li>\n<li>Please submit your application according to the procedures highlighted below.</li>\n<li>You must be from Canada to qualify.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Stack Web/App Developer: Part-Time Track to Full-Time, Remote</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Are you the needle in a haystack?</strong></p>\n<p>Would you like to make sure no one is treated unfairly due to his or her cultural, racial, economical or social status? Would you like to help us create the next generation of educational training and university admissions screening softwares?</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s a little bit about us:</strong></p>\n<p>We believe everyone deserves access to higher education regardless of his or her cultural, racial, economical or social status.</p>\n<p>You've probably never worked with anyone like us before. We're a dynamic team of practicing professionals, researchers, and scholars, with a passion to help students reach their academic and career goals. We often go above and beyond to deliver the best possible services we can for our students. We take our own medicine and we are constantly training to keep our individual performance and the performance of our company exceptional.</p>\n<p>In addition, we are also creating the next generation of university admissions screening software to reduce the social, racial and economic bias while being able to select better-suited applicants AND save time and money for universities and employers.</p>\n<p>We take our role very seriously and contribute to our company on a regular basis whether we work part-time or full-time because we understand the long-term impact of our work. We know how to manage our time and competing demands. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our services and impact and we are not afraid to share our ideas and collaborate with our team members.</p>\n<p>We put our company and our missions first before our own personal needs and desires. This is not a \"job\" to us. This is a calling. Our passion for mentoring our students and making admissions fair and scientifically sound is what gets us up in the morning. Importantly, we understand that our company is only as great as its individual members. That's how we have become a leading academic consulting firm and that's why we are extremely selective about our team and only pick the very best to join us and we do everything we can to support them.</p>\n<p><strong>We'll be honest; working at BeMo isn't for everyone.</strong></p>\n<p>If you are resistant to learn more and continuous coaching because you believe you already know everything about programming, if you are seeking a side job just to make a few bucks, or to add another entry to your resume, if you normally don't pay much attention to detail and your code is always returned by end users full of bugs, or if you are looking for a short-term gig with little impact and growth, then we're probably not right for you.</p>\n<p><strong>But if this is you, you need to apply now.</strong></p>\n<p>If you are a fantastic developer with great attention to detail, yet extremely humble, willing to learn more and are not afraid to explore topics that are not your expertise, love to be a part of the team to change the future of higher education and admissions screening, and looking for a long-term mission with significant impact on society, then you need to apply. Now.</p>\n<p><strong>What we offer:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be a part of our fast growing, innovative and leading academic consulting firm.</li>\n<li>Be part of a revolution. We are creating the next generation of candidate selection tools that are light years ahead at selecting best-suited candidates compared to traditional tools, while being fair to applicants.</li>\n<li>Be part of a team of A-players. We only hire the brightest individuals with the highest caliber, character and courage.</li>\n<li>Freedom to choose your hours. We don't believe in 9-5. We believe in accomplishments of the highest standard.</li>\n<li>Freedom to work from anywhere around the world 90% of the time.</li>\n<li>You never have to go to the \"office\";</li>\n<li>24/7 support. We don't sleep.
